- Often, when we understand a task, an idea of how to solve it pops into our minds and the way from there to going ahead and coding.
- However, there are many things one should take into consideration when deciding on a solution, so going with the first solution that you had in mind without critically examining it will very often get you to either a solution that is not optimal or a solution that just doesn't work.

## Why spend time on planning a solution
- No reinventing the wheel.
	- If we won't be aware of what we already have in our project abd what is available to us, we might end up writting a solution that already exists and is available to use.
- Write compatible code
