## Strategy
### 0. Read the Preface/Foreword
- What is this book about
- Who should read it
- What each chapter explains
- (Sometimes) How to read?

### 1. Scanning
- Scan the chapters I am going to read
	- Go over the titles
	- Glance over the images
	- Observe how long the chapter is and decide if need to split into smaller chunks

### 2. Skimming
- Pay more attention to the subtitles, captioning of the images
- Read the first and last sentences of each paragraph
- Read the code snippets
- Try to get the main idea of each part and do not spend time on details
- Take mental notes (MENTAL not physical)
- Do not linger

### 3. Complete Reading
- Read the chapter completely
- Pay attention to the parts I took mental note
- Close the book and take notes in own word
	- Describe what I've read
	- Summarize
	- If can not find a word to describe it or questioning what I am writing down => Good indicator of not understanding the concept enough
	- Write down question during reading, if it is not answered as I read, start researching
