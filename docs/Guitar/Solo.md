Tips and tricks on how to come up with a guitar improvisation

- Use `Triad`, and use it as the chord tone, and when we play solo we try to end on one of the note in the `Triad`
	- When we try to play solo over chord changes 1 approach is that we can identify the triad and also the pentatonic shape around that, (G chord => G triad => G pentatonic scale at that same position), once we identify all that, we can use the pentatonic to solo and just try to end on the one of the triad 
	- **Observation**
		- Take a look at all the note in [[Pentatonic Scales#^ebdcb9 | Minor pentatonic]] And [[Pentatonic Scales#^df9d10|Major pentatonic]] 
		- We can see that the *leftmost notes* on the first 3 string matches with 1 of the Triad shapes
		- This is because the [[Pentatonic Scales]] is just 5 notes and it guarantees to contains the [[Chord Tones]] in it
		- What this means is that we can combine the pentatonic scale and triad to come up with solo like the example above
- **NOTES**: Always try to identify the chord tones and end on it, can use the above mentioned method or [[Chord Tones#How to find Chord Tones]]
