- A [[Scale]] contains notes, which can be considered ingredients to **create chords from them**
	- Create **Chords** using *tertian* movement, meaning *Root - 3rd - 5th*

*C major scale*: 
![](https://i.imgur.com/3Et6iJg.png)
- We can see that if the *diff between Root and 3rd note* is *2 step* then it is a *Major Chord*, if it is *1.5 step* then it is *Minor Chord*
	- This means that whenever we are doing a *Major chord*, we can just *flat* the *3rd* note to get the *Minor chord*. ^bbc10e
	- So when we are seeing chord name (E.g: *C#/flat Minor/Major*), the *#/flat* tells us where it is on the fretboard, *Minor/Major* tells us if we should *flat* the 3rd note or note.
- The order of chords will always stay the same no matter the major scale. That is: 
	- **1th, 4th, 5th chord is always Major chord**
	- **2nd, 3th, 6th chord is always Minor chord**
	- **7th chord is always Dim**

*C minor scale*:
- Constructing all chords for Cm, we would have
1. Cm
2. D dim
3. Eb
4. Fm
5. Gm
6. Ab
7. Bb
- The order of major/minor/dim will always stay the same no matter the minor scale:
	- **1th, 4th, 5th chords is always Minor chord**
	- **3th, 6th, 7th chord is always Major chord
	- **2nd chord is always Dim**
## Roadmap
![](https://i.imgur.com/3B18JSk.png)
- We can use this roadmap to easily find notes in every key
	- If it is a minor key, the **fret for 2nd -> 3rd, 5th-6th  is right next to each other**
- From this, we can apply the *Major/minor chord formulas* to identify all chords in the chosen key
![](https://i.imgur.com/GiUn81O.png)
	- Then we can play our Pentatonic scale like this:
![](https://i.imgur.com/qkvvObm.jpeg)


- Another roadmap but with root starting on **5th string![GiUn81O.png](https://i.imgur.com/GiUn81O.png)**
	- Then we can play our Pentatonic scale like this:

# Power Chord
- Chords made from the *Root* and *5th* note from the *Root*.
	- The index finger will press the *Root* note
	- The *Root* note is the same note that gives the name of the chord.
- **Root 5th and 6th Shape**:

```
e|----| 
B|----| 
G|----|
D|--3-| 
A|--3-| 
E|1---| 
```
```
e|----| 
B|----| 
G|--3-|
D|--3-| 
A|1---| 
E|----| 
```
- Shape from 5th string and 6th strings are similar, the only difference is that shape from 5th string is one string lower, and we have **mute the 6th string**

# Bar Chord
- One example is *F chord* where we use the Index finger to *barre* the whole fret

![](https://i.imgur.com/oV6dfiI.png)

- This is much more convenient as to change chord, we just need to slide to a different fret with the correct Root note, without having to change finger shape (or just change the finger shape a little bit)

- Example moving: C - G -F

![C chord](https://i.imgur.com/KRXjhk3.png)
![G chord](https://i.imgur.com/3ZIviPH.png)
![F chord](https://i.imgur.com/PIct1AG.png)

- The name of the shapes stem from its open position chord, C shape -> C chord in open position
	- We can think of shapes as an advanced version of open position, we use our `index finger` to barre the fret to stimulate a Capo, and the other fingers just play the shape like in open position => Can think of it as `moving the open position up the neck using index finger as Capo`
- There are a few main **Shapes**:

**E shape**
```
e|1----| 
B|1----| 
G|--2--|
D|----3| 
A|----3| 
E|1----| 
```
- Using this shape, the degree of the note starting from 6th string is `1-3-1-3-5-1`, meaning the Root note is on the 6th & 4th & 1st string, the 3rd note is on the 5th and 3rd string, and the 5rd note is on the 2nd string. 
- For further understanding, we can relates the *E shape* to the [[Scale#Major Scale | Major Scale]] like this:
![](https://i.imgur.com/3OLhtZh.png)
- The blue notes are the note used in *E shape major barre chord*
**A shape**
```
e|1----| 
B|----3| 
G|----3|
D|----3| 
A|1----| 
E|-----| 
```
- Root note in this shape is on the *5th string*, we have to *mute the 6th string*

**C shape**
```
e|1----| 
B|1----| 
G|1----|
D|----3| 
A|----3| 
E|1----| 
```

- **NOTE**: 
	- We can use either *E shape* or *C shape* to play any chord, it is gonna be the same chord but it will sound slightly different.
	- Similar to [[Chords#^bbc10e]], we can apply the same rule to *flat the 3rd note* to achieve *Minor chord*

# Sus4 Chords
- **Sus** stands for **suspended** and it describes the sound of this type of chord well.
- The **4** stands for the note that's a **4th interval** away from your root note.
- A major chord is made up of a **root**, the major **3rd** interval, and the **5th**.
- For a sus4 chord voicing, we’re **exchanging** the **3rd** for the **4th**.

# 7th Chords

## Major 7th: 1-3-5-7 notes
- Example: Amaj7: A - C# - E - G#
- Movable shape:
	- E/6th string root:  
![](https://i.imgur.com/Fqcrrvp.png)
	- A/5th string root:

	- D/4th string root: 



## Minor 7th: 1-b3-5-b7 notes
- Example: Am7:  A - C  - E - G
- Movable shape:
	- E/6th string root:  
![](https://i.imgur.com/fWqFzK2.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/wvLUeQJ.png)
	- D/4th string root: 

## Dominant 7th: 1-3-5-b7 notes

	- D/4th string root: 

# 9th chords
- **Note**
	- 9th chords is quite hard to press so people usually leave the 5th note out for simplicity sake
- 9th note is 2nd note on a higher octave
## Major 9th: 1-3-5-7-9

- Example: Cmaj9: C-E-(G)-B-D

![](https://i.imgur.com/lXrJZxT.png)
	- **This shape is actually movable on 5th and 4th string, so we can slide this across the neck to play maj9 chords wherever we want**  

## Minor 9th
- Example: Em9: E-G-D-F#
- Movable shape:
	- E/6th string root:
![](https://i.imgur.com/i7le5Yf.png)
	- A/5th string root:
![](https://i.imgur.com/SlN0N88.png)
