- A [[Scale]] contains notes, which can be considered ingredients to **create chords from them**
	- Create **Chords** using *tertian* movement, meaning *Root - 3rd - 5th*
- Example:

*C major scale*: 
![](https://i.imgur.com/3Et6iJg.png)
- We can see that if the *diff between Root and 3rd note* is *2 step* then it is a *Major Chord*, if it is *1.5 step* then it is *Minor Chord*
	- This means that whenever we are doing a *Major chord*, we can just *flat* the *3rd* note to get the *Minor chord*. ^bbc10e
	- So when we are seeing chord name (E.g: *C#/flat Minor/Major*), the *#/flat* tells us where it is on the fretboard, *Minor/Major* tells us if we should *flat* the 3rd note or note.
- The order of chords will always stay the same no matter the scale. That is: 
	- **1th, 4th, 5th chord is always Major chord**
	- **2nd, 3th, 6th chord is always Minor chord**
	- **7th chord is always Dim**
# Power Chord
- Chords made from the *Root* and *5th* note from the *Root*.
	- The index finger will press the *Root* note
	- The *Root* note is the same note that gives the name of the chord.
- **Root 5th and 6th Shape**:

```
e|----| 
B|----| 
G|----|
D|--3-| 
A|--3-| 
E|1---| 
```
```
e|----| 
B|----| 
G|--3-|
D|--3-| 
A|1---| 
E|----| 
```
- Shape from 5th string and 6th strings are similar, the only difference is that shape from 5th string is one string lower, and we have **mute the 6th string**

# Barre Chord
- One example is *F chord* where we use the Index finger to *barre* the whole fret
```
e|1----| 
B|1----| 
G|--2--|
D|----3| 
A|----3| 
E|1----| 
```
- This is much more convenient as to change chord, we just need to slide to a different fret with the correct Root note, without having to change finger shape (or just change the finger shape a little bit)
- For example, in *open position*, if we want to change from *C -> G -> F*
```
e|------| 
B|-1----| 
G|------|
D|--2---| 
A|----3-| 
E|------|

e|---3-| 
B|---3-| 
G|-----|
D|-----| 
A|-2---| 
E|---3-| 

e|1----| 
B|1----| 
G|--2--|
D|----3| 
A|----3| 
E|1----| 
```
- But if we use *Barre Chord*:
```
- C chord Barre on 8th fret
e|8----| 
B|8----| 
G|--9--|
D|----10| 
A|----10| 
E|8----| 

- G chord Barre on 3th fret
e|3----| 
B|3----| 
G|--4--|
D|----5| 
A|----5| 
E|3----| 

- F chord Barre on 1th fret
e|1----| 
B|1----| 
G|--2--|
D|----3| 
A|----3| 
E|1----| 
```

- There are a few main **Shapes**:

**E shape**
```
e|1----| 
B|1----| 
G|--2--|
D|----3| 
A|----3| 
E|1----| 
```
- Using this shape, the degree of the note starting from 6th string is `1-3-1-3-5-1`, meaning the Root note is on the 6th & 4th & 1st string, the 3rd note is on the 5th and 3rd string, and the 5rd note is on the 2nd string. 
- For further understanding, we can relates the *E shape* to the [[Scale#Major Scale | Major Scale]] like this:
![](https://i.imgur.com/3OLhtZh.png)
- The blue notes are the note used in *E shape major barre chord*
**A shape**
```
e|1----| 
B|----3| 
G|----3|
D|----3| 
A|1----| 
E|-----| 
```
- Root note in this shape is on the *5th string*, we have to *mute the 6th string*

**C shape**
```
e|1----| 
B|1----| 
G|1----|
D|----3| 
A|----3| 
E|1----| 
```

- **NOTE**: 
	- We can use either *E shape* or *C shape* to play any chord, it is gonna be the same chord but it will sound slightly different.
	- Similar to [[Chords#^bbc10e]], we can apply the same rule to *flat the 3rd note* to achieve *Minor chord*
