- 5 notes in any [[Scale]] that sounds good to each other
- Basic pattern: 
```
e|-1-----4-| 
B|-1-----4-| 
G|-1---3---|
D|-1---3---| 
A|-1---3---| 
E|-1-----4-| 
```

## Usage
1. Find the key of the song
2. Find the root note (the name of the key on the 6th string)
3. If it is a *minor* key then index finger on that root note. If it is *major* then put pinky finger on that root note.

**TIPS**: On any track, the melody needs to go with the current chord, which means we can find the note of the current chord and use it as a starting note of our melody.
- Example: The current chord is C (C - E - G is the notes of C chord), we can start from either C, E, G and play around it until chord change to make it sound good and relevant with the melody.
