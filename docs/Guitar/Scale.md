- A scale in music is a group of notes ordered by sequentially by pitch.
- The scale formed by the group of notes is determined by the **intervals**, or **distance**, between each note of the scale and the number of notes in the scale.
- A general scale has 7 notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), ordered by pitch.

- E.g: If we want to play C scale, we will start from C and go up: C, D, E, F, G, A, B

## Major Scale
- To differentiate if the scale is major or minor, we will use the **distance** between the notes in the scale.
- The pattern for **Major Scale** is: ^7b17ce (*3 to 4 is half*)
```
Whole – Whole –  Half – Whole – Whole – Whole – Half
```

- Using this pattern with the G major scale, you can see how the scale is built: G - A - B - C - D - E - F# - G
z
- From G to A is one whole step, or two half steps (2 semitones) (G – G# – A)
- From A to B is one whole step, or two half steps (A – A# – B)
- From B to C is one half step (B – C)
- From C to D is one whole step (C – C# – D)
- From D to E is one whole step (D – D# – E)
- From E to F# is one whole step (E – F – F#)
- From F# to G is one half step (F# – G)

### How to play

- This is how to play the *G major scale pattern 1* 
- This pattern holds true for any major scale. We can form any **Major Scale** using this.

- This is how to play the *G major scale pattern 2* 
- This pattern holds true for any major scale. We can form any **Major Scale** using this.
- The different is that *pattern 2 shift everything up*, which *takes away the lower root note*, so the *root note is on 4th string*
## Minor Scale
- The difference between the **Minor Scale** and **Major Scale** lies in the **3rd degree** of the scale.
- The major scale contains a **major 3rd**, meaning it is **2 whole step away** from the root
- The minor scale contains a **minor 3rd**, a flattened version of the **major 3rd**, that is **1.5 steps away** from the root.

- The pattern for the **Minor Scale** is: ^94b030 (*2 to 3 is half*)
```
Whole – Half – Whole – Whole – Half – Whole – Whole
```

- Using this pattern with the G minor scale, you can see how the scale is built: G - A - Bb - C - D - Eb - F - G
- This pattern holds true for any minor scale. We can form any **Minor Scale** using this.

## Extra
- It's helpful to know how to play the scale ([[Scale#How to play | How to play major scale]]) anywhere on the neck
	- Help with understanding [[Chords#Barre Chord | Barre Chords]] as the chord is just note from the scale and select by using a certain shape
	- Also have multiple shape to play across the neck.
