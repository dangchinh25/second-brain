- Whenever we try to learn anything, people will try to give you a **Story**, but we should actively listen and look for **Concept**
- Instead of trying to note down everything, we should focus on listening, thinking, and constantly evaluating if the information is *USE*
	- *U*nimportant
	- *S*elf explanatory
	- *E*asy enough to memorize on the spot
- When it comes to the part that seems kinda important, we start taking notes off it. Trust yourself with your own evaluation, if you feel like you don't need to, you'll probably don't need to
- In this way, we both learn during listening, while just note down what will probably trip us up in the future, but not recording what I already know how to do/understand.
- Don't write note **Sequentially**, write note **Conceptually**
- *To remember things, figure out what not to remember*
- Your notes don't have to make sense to anyone, as long as *it makes sense to you*, do whatever you want to make it memorable for you
- Don't try to impose any structures, just let it come naturally as you take notes, we can always go back and update the structure when we have the times the think and reflect. You're never going to get it right the first time.
