	- CPU
	- Motherboard
	- Ram
		- At least 3200 Mhz and Cl-16 Timing
		- At least 16gb
		- Always go in pair, can not have 2 ram of two different capacity and speed
	- Cooler
		- Go for something that is functional and quite
	- GPU

			- Semi modular 
			- Fully modular
	- Storage
		- At least 1 M2 SSD
	- Cases
	- A valid purchased Window OS 

### GPU
- Vram: Similar to RAM but to store whatever the GPU is rendering. More will not necessarily mean better FPS but not enough will definitely hit the performance
	- 4 GB is good for 1080p
	- 8 GB is good for 1440p to 4k
- Core Clock: the frequency at which the GPU is running, measured in HZ. Can be used to compare the power between the same version but not different version as different architecture can make those comparisons invalid
- Boost Clock: the speed a card can boost itself to under a heavy processing load
- Thermal throttling: the speed the card drops down when it gets too hot
- Memory clock: memory bandwidth
- Memory Bus Width
- Type of Memory: GDDR5, GDDR5X, etc
- CUDO Cores - Computed Unifed Device Architecture
	- NVIDIA custom programming language
	- The physical cores in an NVIDIA GPU (Stream Processors in AMD GPUs)
- Transistor Count
