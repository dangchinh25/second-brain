2,Retool AI,"Think of React prompting like a game of charades, where the computer (or model) is playing and learning at the same time. Let's say you're playing charades and your task is to act out ""baking a cake."" To perform well, you need to think about the steps involved in baking, like gathering ingredients, mixing them, baking the mix in the oven, and so on. 

Similarly, React prompting works in a model's task, such as answering a question or finding a fact. It needs to think about the steps, what we can call reasoning, and then act on it, like searching Wikipedia or another database. It switches between ""thinking"" and ""doing"" until it comes up with the correct answer. 

Just like in our cake baking charade, where we need to figure out the actions step-by-step, React prompting allows the model to navigate complex tasks and answer questions more effectively. It ensures that the model can explain its thinking process and can update its knowledge, which makes it even better at solving problems!","""2024-04-14T23:31:31.178Z""",false,true

4,Retool AI,"React prompting involves an interleaved process of reasoning and action within the context of a particular task. It breaks down into multiple phases or steps as follows:

1. **Thought Phase:** The model begins with a thought process. This involves formulating a reason or plan of action in response to a task or problem.

2. **Action Phase:** Based on the reasoning, the model takes an action. This could be anything task-specific, such as performing a search, selecting some data, interacting with a specific tool or environment, etc.

3. **Observation Phase:** After the action is taken, the model observes the result or feedback of the action. This could be the information retrieved from a search or the outcome of some interaction.

4. **Adjustment Phase:** Based on the observation, the model adjusts its reasoning or plan. It refines its strategy or adapts based on new information, similar to learning from experience.

5. **Repetition:** Steps 1-4 are repeated until the task is completed. The cycle helps the model update its knowledge, refine its reasoning process, and learn from its actions and the resulting feedback.

This process helps the model interact with dynamic environments, incorporate additional information into reasoning, and improve its performance across different tasks.","""2024-04-14T23:32:21.468Z""",false,true
Chinh Le,"Can you provide an example, for example my I want to ask the model to create a funny story","""2024-04-14T23:33:35.478Z""",true,5
6,Retool AI,"Sure, applying React prompting to the task of creating a funny story could go like this:

**Thought Phase:** The model starts by thinking about what constitutes a funny story. It might consider things that often make people laugh like unexpected situations, funny characters, or clever use of language.

**Action Phase:** The model starts creating the story. For example, it might start with ""Once upon a time, there was a forgetful elephant named Ella.""

**Observation Phase:** It takes on board the initial story line introduced and observes its context, characters and humor element.

**Adjustment Phase:** Based upon the initial setup, the model might realize the story needs more humor. It might decide to amplify the implications of Ella's forgetfulness for added comedy.

**Repetition:**

- **Thought Phase:** The model thinks about how to integrate more humor into the story.
- **Action Phase:** The model refines the story: ""Ella was so forgetful, she would even forget where she last placed her glasses, which she didn't even need because she had perfect eyesight!"" 
- **Observation and Adjustment Phases,** respectively, continue with revising the elements of the story until it is deemed funny and engaging.

This repetitive process lets the model modify the story, adding and adjusting elements to make it funnier and more engaging until a satisfactory result is achieved.","""2024-04-14T23:33:40.536Z""",false,true
Chinh Le,can I understand that each step is an API call to the model?,"""2024-04-14T23:34:46.226Z""",true,7
8,Retool AI,"The steps within a React prompting process are not necessarily API calls. Instead, the steps can be seen as internal computations or decision-making processes within the model itself. The model uses these steps to form a reasoning process, make an action like retrieving data or making a decision, observing the result of the action, and adjusting its future actions based on the observation. 

However, if you consider the model's interaction with an external environment, for example, when it uses a search or lookup action to interact with a knowledge source like Wikipedia, this could be seen as a form of API call. But the majority of the steps happening inside the React process itself are more about guiding the model's reasoning and decision-making rather than explicit external API calls.","""2024-04-14T23:34:52.463Z""",false,true
Chinh Le,how does the model constitute the Thought phase from the user input?,"""2024-04-14T23:35:48.697Z""",true,9
10,Retool AI,"In the Thought phase, the model uses the user's input along with its trained knowledge to develop a plan or reasoning process. This thought process is not solely based on the user's input but also depends on the model's understanding, context, and past learnings. Here's an example:

If the user input is ""Create a funny story,"" the model first comprehends the task - creating a story that is intended to be funny. The 'thought' at this stage might be about determining what elements could make a story funny. This could include creating humorous characters, introducing unexpected events, or formulating witty dialogues.

This Thought phase showcases the model's internal reasoning process before it starts the Action phase. It sets up the strategy which guides the subsequent steps and actions the model will take. Remember that all of this happens internally within the model based on its pre-trained knowledge and the specific prompting or input it receives from the user.","""2024-04-14T23:35:54.456Z""",false,true
Chinh Le,then how does it constitute the observation phase after getting result from action phase,"""2024-04-14T23:36:56.969Z""",true,11
12,Retool AI,"In the Observation phase, the model critically examines the results or outcomes of the Action phase. The aim is to assess whether the action taken helped to progress towards the goal or solve the problem. 

Using the example of creating a funny story:

**Action Phase:** The model creates the first part of the story: ""Once upon a time, there was a chicken who loved to tell jokes. One day, the chicken decided to enter a joke-telling competition.""

**Observation Phase:** The model 'observes' or reviews what it has generated in the Action phase. It assesses whether the direction of the story aligns with the goal of creating humor. It observes things like - Is the storyline funny? Did the introduction of a joke-telling chicken add a comical element? Is the story's direction promising for adding more humorous situations?

Here, the model is 'observing' or evaluating its own output - similar to how a writer might review the paragraph they've written before deciding what should happen next in the story. 

The information gleaned in the Observation phase then informs the next rounds of Thought and Action phases, and so the iterative process continues.","""2024-04-14T23:37:03.674Z""",false,true
Chinh Le,"let's say I'm trying to build a LLM agent using react prompting, and I'm trying to use OpenAI model by making API call every time I need LLM-reasoning. Can I understand that after getting the result from the action phase, we make another API call to OpenAI with the thought, action, and action result and ask it to evaluate if the result align with the goal?","""2024-04-14T23:42:19.162Z""",true,13
14,Retool AI,"Yes, your understanding is on the right track. To utilize OpenAI's model with the React prompting method using API calls, you could sequence things in the following way:

- **Thought Phase:** You begin with an API call to OpenAI's models, providing the task instruction as input, and asking the model to formulate a plan. This returns the model's 'thought' or plan.

- **Action Phase:** Use the plan to take the appropriate action. This might be another API call to OpenAI's models, asking them to act based on the plan. Depending on the task, this action might be generating more text (like the part of a story), making a prediction, etc.

- **Observation Phase:** You get the result of the action phase. You can then make another API call to OpenAI's model to ask it to evaluate the previous action's result. The input to this call would include the initial thought, action taken, and the result of the action. You'd ask the model to form an understanding of whether the action's result aligns with the goal.

- **Adjustment Phase:** Based on the evaluation in the Observation phase, you might perform another round of Thought and Action phases. You'd feed the result of the preceding steps into the API call, asking the model to adjust its plan accordingly.

Please note, while you certainly can use API calls for each phase, this may not be as smooth or efficient as having a fine-tuned model on your own system. Each API call will cost processing time and could introduce latency into your agent's operation. But conceptually, your understanding is on point.","""2024-04-14T23:42:27.117Z""",false,true
Chinh Le,explain more in detail what does adjustment phase do and what happens after that,"""2024-04-14T23:44:11.516Z""",true,15
16,Retool AI,"The Adjustment phase takes place after the Observation phase and it's where the model uses the insights gained from observing the results of the Action phase for improvements in the strategy or plan. In this phase, the model identifies any adjustments needed to achieve the desired goal. 

Regarding what happens after the Adjustment phase, the Rect prompting process is iterative and follows a cycle. So, after the Adjustment phase comes another Thought phase, and the cycle starts anew. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

- **Adjustment Phase:** The model reconsiders the strategy once it has observed the results of the Action phase. If the result was not in line with the goal, the thought process is adjusted to correct the course. This could involve developing a new angle for a story or choosing a different approach to solve a problem based on the learnings so far.

- Then comes the **Thought Phase** again: With the adjustments in mind, the model formulates another plan or approach to address the task, keeping in mind the information observed and the adjustments derived.

- Next, the **Action Phase** takes place again: Based on the new or adjusted thought, the model takes another action. This action depends on the adjusted plan.

- The model then moves on to the **Observation Phase**, where it again evaluates the new actions and so on.

This cycle continues until the goal is accomplished or if a stop condition is met. It's a process of iterative refinement, where each cycle helps the model improve the strategies it uses to accomplish its goal.","""2024-04-14T23:44:18.279Z""",false,true
Chinh Le,"and I guess at each step, along with the data from previous step, we also need to include a specific prompt?","""2024-04-14T23:45:44.822Z""",true,17
18,Retool AI,"Yes, each step ideally includes specific prompts to guide the model. When making API calls in an iterative manner, you would generally use the output of the previous step as input to the next step, along with a new query or ""prompt"" that guides what you want the model to do next. 

For example:
- In the Thought Phase, your prompt might ask the model to generate a plan based on the task at hand.
- In the Action Phase, your prompt could instruct the model to execute the plan or take a specific action.
- In the Observation Phase, your prompt might request the model to evaluate the outcome of the action.
- In the Adjustment Phase, your prompt could ask the model how it might adjust its plan based on the evaluation.

Keep in mind that specific prompts depend on the model you're using, the task you're working on, and the specific format required for successful interaction with the model. The goal is to help the model understand at each step what is expected of it, and guide it towards producing the desired output.","""2024-04-14T23:45:51.865Z""",false,true
