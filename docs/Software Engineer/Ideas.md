Building B2B Saas we would need a lot of built-in and template
- E.g: Retool Workflow is nice, but Tines workflow has a lot of template which saves a lot of time => Customer like it more
- Any customer-built features need some kind of template to save time (e.g: Prompt template for AI actionsPrompt template for AI actions)

B2B SaaS common requirements for enterprise customers:
- Permissioning (ACL)
- Audit logs
- Custom connectors (enterprise customer like to do things their way so it's important to provide different granular options)
- Security
- On-prem?
