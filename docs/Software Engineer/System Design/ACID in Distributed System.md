- This is slightly different from [[RDBMS#ACID]]
- In multiservices architectures:
	- *Atomicity* is an indivisible and irreducible set of operations that must all occur or none occur.
	- *Consistency* means the [[Transactions]] brings the data only from one valid state to another valid state.
	- *Isolation* guarantees that concurrent [[Transactions]] produce the same data state that sequentially executed [[Transactions]] would have produced.
	- *Durability* ensures that committed [[Transactions]] remain committed even in case of system failure or power outage.
- [[Transactions]] within a single service are ACID, but cross-service data consistency requires a cross-service transaction management strategy.
