- Still not understand much but the general strategy is that we can buy and hold from a various of index fund/mutual fund/bond
- Can use either Robinhood or some other options (Charles Schwab or Fidelity) (seems like CharlesSchwab and Fidelity is better than RH)

- Normal brokerage account vs Roth IRA
	- Brokerage account takes in after-tax money and withdrawals is also taxable
	- Roth IRA also takes in after-tax money but withdrawals is tax free, but is only available after 59 1/2, otherwise under penalty
